# Elastic SIEM Home Lab Setup

## Introduction

I recently completed a lab where I set up a home environment for Elastic Security Information and Event Management (SIEM). This was a great opportunity to learn about SIEM concepts and gain hands-on experience with the Elastic Stack.

## Key Learnings

* **SIEM Fundamentals:** I learned about the key components of SIEM and how they work together to detect and respond to security threats.
* **Elastic Stack Configuration:** I gained experience installing and configuring Elasticsearch, Kibana, and Beats.
* **Security Event Analysis:** I learned how to generate security events and use Elastic SIEM to query, visualize, and analyze them.
* **Dashboard and Alert Creation:** I created dashboards and alerts to monitor for specific security threats and respond to them in a timely manner.

## Challenges and Solutions

* **[Challenge 1]** I encountered an issue with initially getting Kali Linux setup properly. I resolved this by going a to a different site to grab the ISO file.
* **[Challenge 2]** I had difficulty with getting correct nmap detections the first time through. I overcame this by doing a module on NMAP on the Tryhackme platform and re-reading the instructions to see what I may have overlooked.

## Conclusion

This lab was a valuable learning experience and I'm excited to continue exploring the capabilities of Elastic SIEM. I plan to use this knowledge to strengthen my skills in cybersecurity and threat detection.
